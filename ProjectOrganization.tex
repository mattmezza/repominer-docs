		\section{Process model}
		
		The chosen proces model will be the spiral model, with 2 iterations. Unlike
		the waterfall process, we will be able to show partial versions to the customer 
		for feedback, reducing risks such as faulty requirements. 
		
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\caption{A general example of the spiral model with 2 iterations.}
		\end{figure}
		
		In our case, this will be defined as: \\
		
		\begin{tabular}{l l l}
			\FL Workflow & Completion date & Deliverable to customer
			\ML \textbf{Flow 1}
			\NN Requirements & 09/11/09 & ??/11/09
			\NN Design & 23/11/09
			\NN Implementation & 07/12/09
			\NN Testing & 16/12/09 & 2*/12/09
			\NN
			\NN \textbf{Flow 2}
			\\ Will be defined later. \\
		\end{tabular} 
		
		A more specific planning will be described in section XXXX	
		
		\section{Organizational structure}
		\label{sec:struc}
		
		The structure of our team will be organised as followed:
		
		\subsection{Project Manager}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Head of the project team
				\item Deliver the SPMP
				\item Risk Analysis
				\item Keep track of the project's progress
				\item Manage timesheets

			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Quality Assurance Manager}
			\begin{itemize}
					\item Head of quality team
					\item Deliver SQAP and STD
					\item Design and implement test framework
					\item Coordinate testing as defined in STD
					\item Verify the general quality of the product
					\item Verify the quality of documents
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Requirements Manager}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Deliver SRS
				\item Check whether the requirements are implemented
				\item Look for extra functional requirements

				\item Deliver SDD based on the SRS
				\item Manage design of the system
				\item Check whether implementation is based on the SDD
				\item Design and manage database according to SRS and SQAP
				\item Present design to the customer
			\end{itemize}	
			
		\subsection{Implementation Manager}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Head of implementation management
				\item Manage the integration of different parts of the code
				\item Track errors
				\item Define implementation proces based on the SDD	
				\item Manage documentation of code
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Webmaster}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Develop and maintain project website
				\item Upload documents, after approval of the project manager
			\end{itemize}	
		
		\section{Organizational boundaries and interfaces}
		
		The external communication with the customer will only happen via the project
		manager, the requirements manager and the design manager. The project manager reports
		major problems, progress status and other organisatorial issues. 
		The requirements manager discusses the functionality of the system and 
		the design manager will present the design of the system to the
		customer.  
		
		\section{Project responsibilities}
		
			The responsibilities, as defined in \ref{sec:struc}, will be 
			associated to the following persons:
		
			\begin{tabular}{l l l}
				\\
				\FL Role & Effective & Assistant
				\ML Project Manager & Nick & Patrick
				\NN Project Secretary & Jonathan & Wouter
				\NN Configuration Manager & Jorne & Sina
				\NN Quality Assurance Manager & Patrick & Bart
				\NN Requirements Manager & Wouter & Jonathan
				\NN Design Manager & Bart & Nick
				\NN Implementation Manager & Sina & Jorne
				\NN Webmaster & Sina & Wouter \\
				\\
			\end{tabular}
			\\
			However, this does not mean that a person is only responsible
			for his/her own function. Every team member can be asked for assistance in all 
			processes in function to achieve the end goal.
			
			A person responsible for creating a deliverable also needs to be aware
			of the fact that
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Documents will be writen in \LaTeX-format, using the provided template.
				
				\item Documents need to be ready in time (as defined in \ref{deadlines}), and
				sent to the project manager for approval. 
				
				\item Documents needs to be up-to-date during the entire project. 
				
			\end{itemize}
